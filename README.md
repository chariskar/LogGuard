# Logger 

All loggers have the exact same usage for example.

# Python

  from LogGuard import Logger
  
  logger = Logger()

  logger.log('info','Hello')


# Contribute

If you want to contribute to the codebase your code must fit the code style.

If you are contributing to the JavaScript or Typescript Loggers make sure to use the ready .eslintrc.json file for code styling and obviously use the eslint plugin.

If you contribute to python run pylint logger.py the score must always be above 8 anything else will be rejected also use the PyLint extension.

# Instalation

I decided to not put the code on any package manager (they did not want to work for some reason) so to install them you just grab the files you want for example the logger file and the log_settings.json file or the styling files if you like


# Important 
  The Loggers inside their own branches are the alpha/beta versions the stable versions are in the main branch
